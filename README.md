Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to design a computer vision model capable of detecting and localizing multiple objects within an image. The task involves predicting object classes along with bounding box coordinates, enabling automated visual recognition for real-world applications such as surveillance, automation, or image analytics.

Data Type:
Image data (computer vision modality) consisting of visual inputs requiring preprocessing, resizing, and augmentation.

Dataset Used:
An annotated image dataset containing labeled object classes and bounding box coordinates. Each image includes spatial annotations that allow the model to learn object localization and classification simultaneously.
